A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup.

1) First, compute the keys hash code (usually an int or long). Note that 2 diff keys
can have the same hash code, as there may be an infinite number of keys and a finite
number of ints. 

2. Then, map the hash code to an index in the array. This can be done with something
like hash(key) % array_length. 2 different hash codes could map to the same index

3. At this index, there is a linked list of keys and values. Store this key and values
in this index. We must use a linkedlist because of collisions. You could have 2 different 
keys with the same hash codes, or two different hash codes that map to the same index. 

To retrieve the value pair by its key, you repeat the process. 

If collisions are high: Worst case - 0(N)
However, we generally assume a good implementation, that keeps collisions to a min, so 
its - 0(1)
